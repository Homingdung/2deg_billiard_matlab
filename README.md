## Introduction
This is the summer internship project under the supervision of Dr. Martin Richter, University of Nottingham.

**Title**: Transfer Operator Methods - Transport 2d Electron Gases

**Background**: Transfer operator methods have been proven successful in a range of industrial applications concerned with vibrational energy distribution in the high-frequency regime using a method called Dynamical Energy Analysis. Here, we apply the same techniques on the classical orbits of electrons.
The motivation for this research are transport phenomena which show surprising features in resistances between point contacts. While we will focus on the mathematical foundations of the theory, there is potential to compare to actual measured data.

**Project Description**: Aim of this project is to derive a formula for the electronic transport in a so called two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). These are specifically designed interfaces between semiconductors in which electrons are restricted to two dimensions. By applying voltages to a top contact, the area of movement can be freely designed. This is the fundamental concept of so called MOSFET transistors ubiquitious in nowadays electronics.

From a dynamical systems point of view, interesting phenomena can arise when the geometry or other parameters, like a perpendicular magnetic field, are changed. They lead to bifurcations and a generic KAM route to chaos thereby highly influencing the transport properties.

In this project, your task will be to solve the equations of motion in presence of a magnetic field. Then, a so called Poincar√© Section (also called Boundary map in Birkhoff coordinates) can be defined. Using this, your task is to create a transfer operator to allow for the propagation of densities of initial conditions.
This transfer operator arises from the equations of motion and can be expressed as an integral over initial conditions.
