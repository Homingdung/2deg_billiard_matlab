# Background Knowledge

## [Kicked system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kicked_rotator)

The model describes a particle constrained to move on a ring. The particle is kicked periodically. The model could be described by Hamiltonian:
$$
H(p,\theta,t)=\frac{1}{2}p^2+\frac{K}{\pi^2}cos(\pi\theta)\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t-n)
$$
Where 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\theta_{n+1}=\theta_n+\pi p_{n}\\
&&p_{n+1}=p_n+\frac{K}{\pi}sin(\theta_n+\pi p_n)
\end{eqnarray}
$$
both $\theta$ and $p$ will take modulo, $2\pi$ and $2$, respectively, which could be used to create a 2D standard map.

## [Poincaré map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map)

In the theory of dynamical systems, a Poincaré map is an intersection of periodic orbits in state space with a certain lower-dimensional subspace, called Poincaré section.

## Birkhoff coordinate

Birkhoff coordinate, also known as boundary coordinate, which can be used to define a natural Poincaré section, specifies the collision point, with which could be displayed on a phase-space with $(s,p)$, where $s$ is the position along the boundary, and $p$ is the projected momentum on the boundary. Based on Birkhoof coordinate, a list of points could be generated by Poincaré mapping and then get the boundary map which is a special type of Poincaré section by visualizing these points.

## [Bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory)

Bifurcation of a system occurs when a small, smooth change in a parameter causes the system to suddenly behave in a qualitative or topological way. There are two principle types of bifurcation:

+ Local bifurcations
+ Global bifurcations



## Transfer operator

In a simple way, transfer operator could be seen as the behavior of a dynamical system on the mass density of initial conditions. Transfer operators methods have been successfully applied to Dynamical Energy Analysism, which has a wide range of industrial applications. In this research, the transfer operator arises from the equations of motion and can be expressed as an integral over initial conditions.



## [2DEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_electron_gas)

Two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is a solid-state physics model. This project is to derive a formula for the 2DEG transport.
